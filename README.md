# ElectionWebsite

The Election Website I designed for Vidya Valley School.

The project is closed-source right now. I will make it open-source soon.

A demo of the website can be found here: https://vvs-e21.herokuapp.com/

Use username: test@email.com and password: test1122 for testing.

Note: "Jaguar", "Cheetah", "Sher" and "Puma" are the 4 houses in Vidya Valley School.
